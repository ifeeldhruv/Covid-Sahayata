                  <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-2"><b>Myth: Vaccines can cause severe side-effects like autism in children and even death</b>
                    <br>
                    <span class="u-text-palette-1-base"> Fact: This is one of the most common myths around vaccines among a lot of people, said Dr Vishal Sehgal, Medical Director, Portea Medical. According to him, autism has been falsely linked with some vaccines MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella) vaccine but a number of studies have been undertaken that have proved that there is no association between immunisation and autism. He said that such rumours get wind because in most cases, children are diagnosed with autism around the same time as their immunisation schedule. He further asserted that vaccinations do not cause any fatal disease or death. Side-effects of vaccines are rare and mild that include fever or slight pain in the area where the vaccine was administered but these wane away soon, he said.</span>
                    <br>
                    <br><b>Myth: Vaccines are not required, maintaining proper hygiene is enough to protect from viruses</b>
                    <br>
                    <span class="u-text-palette-1-base"> Fact: Experts say that while maintaining</span>

                    <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">roper hygiene and sanitation will ensure a better standard of life and reduce the risk of infection, it will not protect against such infectious diseases that can spread despite cleanliness and good living conditions. Dr Sehgal said that delaying or denying vaccination will make people vulnerable to a number of infections.</span>
                    <br>
                    <br><b>Myth: It is better to get immunity by acquiring the infection naturally as compared to vaccination</b>
                    <br>
                    <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Fact: Vaccines trigger the immune response in the body in a similar way to the response produced by natural infection, without putting the health and life of the individual at risk, said Dr K K Aggarwal, President, Confederation Of Medical Associations In Asia And Oceania. He said that the risk in getting immunity through natural infection is high and can be life-threatening.</span>

There will also be a walk-in provision for the beneficiaries to get themselves registered at a nearby session site to get vaccinated. A beneficiary will just have to register with his or her mobile number and in turn, will receive an OTP with which his/her account will be created. One can also get their family members registered on the account.<br>The new version of the Co-WIN platform will be GPS-enabled and the beneficiaries will have the option to choose the inoculation session site both at the government and private facilities. One will also have the option to get inoculated in a state different from his or her home state.
